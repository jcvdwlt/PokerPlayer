A Reinforement Learning Texas Holdem poker player.

Here is a 3 person example tournament, with a RL player, a random player, and a very simple rational player (which only considers hand type, but not individual cards).

The RL player's randomness is reduced linearly over the first half of the tournament, after which it is fixed at 5%.
